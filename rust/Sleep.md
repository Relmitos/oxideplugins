**Sleep** allows players with permission to get a well-rested sleep. While sleeping, players may grow hungry, get thirsty, and even get a bit dirty depending on settings.


By default, players will heal and restore 5 percent of their current levels every 10 seconds; and get dirty, hungry, and thirsty by 5 percent of their current levels every 10 seconds. Curing is also available, but disabled by default. Everything is changeable in the config file.

**Permissions**

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **oxide.grant user <username|steamid> <permission>**. To remove a permission, use **oxide.revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>**.

The configuration file will update automatically if new options are added or removed. I'll do my best to preserve any existing settings and messages with each new version.
