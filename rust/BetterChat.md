If you have this installed and you see somebody called [Plugin Developer] LaserHydra, thats me visiting your server.

Chat-/Console Formatting :


* You can do a lot with the "Formatting" of a group. you can customize it with

* {Title} = Group Title
* {Name} = Player Name
* {SteamID} = Player SteamID
* {Message} = Message
* {Date} = Time Stamp
* {Group} = Primary Group



... but also just add words, letters, numbers, and symbols to it. You could just put the Title behind the name for example.
